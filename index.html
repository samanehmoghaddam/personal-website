      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Samaneh, you can call me Sama.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I am an AI researcher and applied ML engineer who enjoys turning advanced models into real, reliable, and impactful systems. I work across LLMs, agentic AI, cybersecurity, and ML-driven product development.</p>
      <p>My career has been shaped by both hands-on engineering and strategic product ownership. I’ve built and deployed credit-scoring and risk-management microservices in the largest banking platform in Iran, and I currently work on adaptive grounding mechanisms for language models at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute. This hybrid path, moving between research, engineering, and product thinking, has shaped the way I approach problems: scientifically curious, practical in execution, and always attentive to real-world reliability and safety.</p>
      <p>I thrive in multidisciplinary environments, whether collaborating with other researchers and domain experts who may not work directly with AI, or working alongside data engineers, product managers, and stakeholders in an enterprise setting. I enjoy translating across technical, business, and user perspectives to ensure shared understanding and to deliver AI systems that are both rigorous and scalable.</p>
      <p>I care deeply about AI that is not only accurate, but robust, responsible, and useful especially. My goal is to continue bridging research, engineering, and product strategy to create AI systems that deliver meaningful real-world value.</p>
