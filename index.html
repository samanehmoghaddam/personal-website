      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Samaneh, you can call me Sama.</p>
      <p>I am an AI researcher and applied ML engineer who enjoys turning advanced models into real, reliable, and impactful systems. I work across LLMs, agentic AI, cybersecurity, and ML-driven product development.</p>
      <p>My career has been shaped by both hands-on engineering and strategic product ownership. I’ve built and deployed credit-scoring and risk-management microservices in the largest banking platform in Iran, and I currently work on adaptive grounding mechanisms for language models at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute.</p>
      <p>What makes my profile unique is the combination of deep technical expertise + product thinking + secure engineering. This allows me to contribute in roles such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Senior ML Engineer / Applied Scientist (LLMs, NLP, MLOps, model adaptation)</li>
        <li>AI Product Lead / Product Owner (data products, ML-driven platforms, responsible AI)</li>
        <li>Research Scientist (adaptive learning, safety, agentic AI)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I thrive in cross-functional, multi-disciplinary environments — whether collaborating with data engineers, product managers, designers, and risk teams in a large enterprise, or wearing multiple hats in startup-style teams. I enjoy translating between technical, business, and user perspectives to ensure alignment and deliver AI systems that scale.</p>
      <p>I care deeply about AI that is not only accurate, but robust, responsible, and useful especially in finantial, insurance, social platforms, fintech, and digital ecosystems. My goal is to continue bridging research, engineering, and product strategy to create AI systems that deliver meaningful real-world value.</p>
