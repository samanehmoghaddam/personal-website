            <h2>Research Experience</h2>
        
            <h3>Abusive Language Detection & Adaptive NLP Models (2023–Present)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of abusive language informed by linguistic theory and empirical ML analysis; unified heterogeneous, multi-labeled datasets to create a scalable benchmark.</li>
                <li>Improved model generalizability through dataset aggregation, multi-task learning, and multi-label harmonization—results published at CASC 2025.</li>
                <li>Developed an LLM-based adaptive classifier (“AbuseBERT”) with significant gains in cross-dataset robustness; released as an open-source model on HuggingFace.</li>
                <li>Introduced progressive learning and neology detection mechanisms to adapt to emerging abusive terms and semantic drift in streaming social data.</li>
                <li>Led collection and analysis of a 2M+ tweet longitudinal dataset targeting Canadian public health officials during COVID-19, studying temporal dynamics of online abuse.</li>
                <li>Modeled correlations between abuse escalation and contextual factors (e.g., policy announcements, epidemiological metrics), and developed predictive models for policy-aware risk forecasting.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Detection of Fake Accounts Controlled by Social Bots (2016–2022)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduced a novel digital-footprint–based feature category (“Friendship Preference”) enabling scalable detection of coordinated and stealthy malicious AI agents; published in IEEE TDSC (2022).</li>
                <li>Conducted large-scale statistical analysis and developed 12 machine learning classifiers using behavioral, relational, and temporal features.</li>
                <li>Designed and implemented 256 distinct bot infiltration strategies to study adversarial behaviors, influence patterns, and system vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Developed a cost–benefit analytical model assessing the economic feasibility of large-scale social bot networks (published in IET Information Security, 2020).</li>
                <li>Engineered multiple Twitter-based datasets using automated pipelines for graph extraction, user profiling, and behavioral annotation.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Anomaly Detection in Mobile Communication Networks (2013–2014)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Performed frequent graph mining over mobile device communication graphs to identify abnormal structural and temporal patterns.</li>
                <li>Developed semi-supervised anomaly detection models to capture rare and evolving network threats in 3G/4G systems.</li>
                <li>Simulated large-scale mobile communication networks and injected malicious behavior to validate anomaly detection performance under controlled adversarial scenarios.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Android Malware Detection via Static Analysis (2012–2013)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Applied static-analysis pipelines to extract features from Android APKs for malware classification.</li>
                <li>Built and evaluated ML models for detecting malicious patterns in application code and permissions.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Software Watermarking & Software Protection (2005–2007)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed ML-based methods for evaluating stealthiness and detectability of software watermarking schemes.</li>
                <li>Applied multi-criteria decision-making to assess resilience against attacks; introduced a new watermarking algorithm and improved two existing methods.</li>
                <li>Published multiple peer-reviewed papers in software security and watermarking, with contributions spanning graph watermarking, dummy-block methods, and resilience modeling.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Semantic Parsing & Keyword Extraction for Persian (2003–2004)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed a grammar-based semantic parser for extracting meaningful keywords and logical expressions (AND/OR/NOT) from Persian sentences to support intelligent search systems.</li>
            </ul>
